          <h2>The Benefits of Gender Diversity on Engineering Teams</h2>

            <h5>Personal Note</h5>
            <p>Before we look at the research surrounding the benefits of gender diversity on engineering teams, I would like to begin with a personal note. Recently it has been reported that BSU professor Scott Yenor has made public comments that </p>
         <blockquote cite="https://www.idahostatesman.com/news/local/education/article256193492.html">“Our independent women are more medicated, meddlesome, and quarrelsome than women need to be. Young men must be respectable and responsible to inspire young women to be secure with feminine goals of homemaking and having children…Every effort must be made not to recruit women into engineering, but rather to recruit and demand more of men who become engineers.” 
</blockquote>
            <p>This attitude is very familiar to me—I grew up in a very conservative religious community where careers and education were considered a backup plan for women, and I spent much of my youth trying to squelch the parts of me that were considered “too masculine”—my analytical mind, deep curiosity, love of problem solving, intense work drive, and ambition.  However, as I began to learn to code and build software, I found these things are not personality flaws, but some of my biggest strengths and the core of what makes me a good computer engineer. I have also been fortunate to have found an engineering community of like-minded people that encourage me to be my best and happiest self. </p>
            <p>While this post examines the benefits of gender diversity, I am not an engineer because of gender politics on either side, or because studies say it is beneficial for women to be on STEM teams. I am an engineer because that is what I like to wake up and do every day. I belong in engineering for the same reason that my male peers belong here—because I have the capacity and passion to solve problems and build solutions. </p>
