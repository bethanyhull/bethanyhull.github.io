          <h2>The Benefits of Gender Diversity on Engineering Teams</h2>
        </div>
        <div class="row">
            <h5>Personal Note</h5>
            <p>Before we look at the research surrounding the benefits of gender diversity on engineering teams, I would like to begin with a personal note. Recently it has been reported that BSU professor Scott Yenor has made public comments that </p>
         <blockquote cite="https://www.idahostatesman.com/news/local/education/article256193492.html">“Our independent women are more medicated, meddlesome, and quarrelsome than women need to be. Young men must be respectable and responsible to inspire young women to be secure with feminine goals of homemaking and having children…Every effort must be made not to recruit women into engineering, but rather to recruit and demand more of men who become engineers.” 
</blockquote>
            <p>This attitude is very familiar to me—I grew up in a very conservative religious community where careers and education were considered a backup plan for women, and I spent much of my youth trying to squelch the parts of me that were considered “too masculine”—my analytical mind, deep curiosity, love of problem solving, intense work drive, and ambition.  However, as I began to learn to code and build software, I found these things are not personality flaws, but some of my biggest strengths and the core of what makes me a good computer engineer. I have also been fortunate to have found an engineering community of like-minded people that encourage me to be my best and happiest self. </p>
           
            <p>While this post examines the benefits of gender diversity, I am not an engineer because of gender politics on either side, or because studies say it is beneficial for women to be on STEM teams. I am an engineer because that is what I like to wake up and do every day. I belong in engineering for the same reason that my male peers belong here—because I have the capacity and passion to solve problems and build solutions. </p>
          <h5>Team Dynamics</h5>
            <p>Gender diversity is encouraged in STEM often for social or political reasons. Given the recent popularity of third wave feminism and movements such as “Me Too”, it stands to reason that companies like to appear progressive to garner the favor of public opinion and to avoid possible lawsuits. And while gender diversity can be a worthy social and political goal itself, recent research is beginning to show additional benefits to having a team with gender parity. Specifically, that team dynamics and collaboration improve, and higher levels of collective intelligence can lead to more innovative engineering solutions.  </p>
            <p>Good collaboration and healthy team dynamics are vital to good software teams. The agile methods used by most modern teams require a high level of coherence and collaboration to be effective, making team dynamics a vital part of the software engineering process. Studies have found that men and women have very different interpersonal styles. “Men’s style was more autocratic than women’s, i.e. involved giving orders, whereas women’s style was more democratic than men’s, i.e. focused on participation. In addition, when comparing all-female versus all-male groups, all-female groups demonstrate more egalitarian behaviors, such as equal amounts of communication among group members and shared leadership”   This mix of interpersonal skills has a positive effect on the dynamics of the team—encouraging more team members to actively participate in the groups and to take ownership of their work. A more egalitarian environment will also encourage team members to share ideas that perhaps would not have otherwise. These skills would greatly improve the quality of standups, sprint retrospectives, and other team meetings and interactions that require team members to offer honest feedback and take ownership of tasks and stories.  </p>
            <h5>Creating a global solution</h5>
            <p>There are a few instances that inevitably come to mind when thinking of products that were released that unknowingly are developed with a large amount of unknown bias, including the automatic sink that would detect hands of a light-skinned person, but not a dark-skinned person, or the facial recognition system that can recognize the face of a white man with > 90% accuracy, but recognized the face of a black woman with <50% accuracy. This bias was certainly not intended but can have huge consequences. From an engineering perspective it seems that the teams that developed this product didn’t have a firm grasp on the entire problem they were solving for since their solution contained issues that they were unable to see.    </p>
            <p>These days a great deal of software is being built for a global market and to be successful as well as ethical, it stands to reason that the software must work at some level for most people who need to use it on a regular basis.  These solutions are complex and often require an intimate understanding of the problems facing specific populations. A possible solution to this issue is to compose teams of people who have varied backgrounds that allow them to see the problem from different angles or perspectives, and by doing so eliminate some of the blind spots each engineer has individually. </p>
          <h5>The Importance of Gender Parity</h5>
            <p>It is important to note that all these benefits are the results of gender parity within teams. Several interesting studies found that in gender-balanced occupations, gender diversity had a significantly positive effect. However, in traditionally male-dominated fields such as computer science, gender diversity had strong negative effects on team performance until the ratio of women to men reached at least 50% at which point the negative effects were erased or reversed. This has been attributed to the difficulty it is for women to fully contribute when they are the token woman on the tam or in the minority. Thy find it difficult to compete against negative stereotypes and do their best work, which in turn decreases the efficiency of their teams. This suggests that integrating women into a traditionally male dominated field such as tech will be difficult at first. But as negative stereotypes fade, and diversity becomes the new norm the initial negative effects will be replaced by the benefits that can be seen in more gender-balanced occupations.  </p>
